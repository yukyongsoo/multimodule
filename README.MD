# Agile Dead Trees(이하 ADT)

A publisher wants to unify its authoring Content Management System (CMS) and customer store experience, trying to get books published to customers as quickly as possible.

Users: dozens of publisher employees, hundreds of authors, thousands/millions of customers

Requirements:  
1. authors publish chapters  
2. reviewers see the chapters, make review comments, and notify authors on review  
3. authors can reject proposed review changes  
4. supports both copy and technical editing  
5. customers can buy books (either e- form or dead trees form) online, including those available in 'beta'  
6. publisher can push authors' chapters to those customers who bought the 'beta'  

Additional Context:  
1. The business is driven to this decision because competitors have a similar offering.  
2. Competition for authors is tight.  
3. This is part of a long-term strategy to modernize the publishing aspects of the business.  
4. Information needed to publish a book (distribution, royalties, marketing) comes from several disparate systems, ranging from emailed Excel spreadsheets to mainframe integration with the printing facility.
