Users

Requirements

1. Students will only be able to use the application within testing centers around the state, most of these will be in the schools, but not all of them  
2. Students should be able to take a test, and the results eventually consolidated to a single location representing all of the test scores across the state (by school, teacher, and student).  
3. Tests will be multiple choice, short answer, and essay.  
4. The system should have a reporting system to know which students have taken the tests and what score they received.  
5. Short answer and essay questions will be manually graded by teachers, who will then add the essay grades to the system.
